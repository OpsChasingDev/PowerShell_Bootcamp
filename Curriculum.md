## WHAT IS POWERSHELL
- Brief history on where PowerShell comes from, what it's used for, and where it is now
  - PowerShell is NOT cmd
  - Jeffrey Snover stressed the importance of a shell-based management tool
  - .NET and C#
- Windows PowerShell vs PowerShell (core)
- Installing PowerShell

- What is PowerShell capable of doing for us and why do we care?
  - makes bulk administration and automation easy for operations engineers and systems administrators
  - built-in providers
  - built on a highly capable framework
  - easy-to-use documentation and help system
  - cross-platform
  - highly secure
  - broad spectrum of community-driven modules
  - we get to work with objects!
- SysAdmins are NOT Developers
  - PowerShell acts as a programming language, but how we use it is not like a developer (normally)
  - if this is the first computer language you're really learning, do not be afraid! (and you picked one of the best)

## DISCOVERABILITY
- the cmdlet structure
- finding cmdlets to use
- finding help on specific cmdlets
- finding help on larger concept topics
- finding modules

## VARIABLES

## WORKING WITH COLLECTIONS
- what is a collection?

## OBJECTS AS THE FOUNDATION OF POWERSHELL'S POWER
- what makes objects special
- identifying what kinds of objects you're working with
- seeing object members
- properties vs methods
- the pipeline
- how objects link through the pipeline
- sorting and filtering output
